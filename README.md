Localization
============

Localizations of various things.

This repo is avaliable on [GitHub](https://github.com/angelXwind/Localization) (main) and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/angelXwind/localization) (mirror).

KBatteryDoctorPro Localization Project
============

Seeing as this project gained traction from that one /r/jailbreak thread...

I (Karen/angelXwind) will be making some announcements here.

For one, the official name of this app is apparently "KBatteryDoctorPro," and not any variation of that. However, it seems that even in their official DefaultFlow.png, they call it "BatteryDoctorPro," so... I'll ask the author about this.

Secondly, it's preferred that you tell me your GitHub/BitBucket username so I can add you as contributors to the Git repo. This way, we don't need to play around with forks and pull requests.

Third, image editing. I'm not sure about the author's stance on placing watermarks over the images... (as one Localization here has done, though I've removed that for now)

Fourth, we need some sort of form of communication. I run my own IRC server, connect to [irc.angelxwind.net / #KBDPLocalization](irc://irc.angelxwind.net/KBDPLocalization). I'm angelXwind there. If you don't have an IRC client, click [here](http://iris.stormbit.net/?nick=&channels=KBDPLocalization) to use webchat. You may message me on reddit as well (angelXwind).
